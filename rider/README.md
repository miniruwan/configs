# Jetbrains Rider IDE Configurations
### Introduction
This directory includes my configuration files for [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### How to use
#### Keymaps
These keymaps are mainly because some of the default keymaps conflicts with ideavim plugin's keys. So I've remapped them.
Symlink to this file from the Rider's configuration directory.
Example:
```mklink C:\Users\miniruwan.mangala\.Rider2019.3\config\keymaps\Miniruwan.xml C:\Projects\dotfiles\rider\keymaps\Miniruwan.xml```

#### IdeaVim
Refer [vim/Jetbrains_Rider](../vim/Jetbrains_Rider) directory for [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) configuration files
